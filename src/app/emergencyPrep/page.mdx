## Priorities in an Outdoor Emergency
Outdoor survival often boils down to two fundamental necessities: fire and shelter. These two elements are critical for staying alive and comfortable in a wilderness or survival situation.

1. **Fire:** Fire serves multiple essential purposes:
   - **Warmth:** Fire provides heat, which is vital for maintaining body temperature in cold environments. Exposure to low temperatures can lead to hypothermia, a potentially life-threatening condition. A fire helps combat this by providing warmth.
   - **Cooking:** Fire allows you to cook food, making it safe to eat and more palatable. It also kills harmful pathogens that may be present in raw food.
   - **Purifying Water:** Boiling water over a fire is an effective way to purify it, making it safe to drink. This is crucial for preventing waterborne illnesses.
   - **Protection:** A fire can deter wildlife and insects, reducing the risk of encounters with potentially dangerous animals.
   - **Signaling:** A well-tended fire can serve as a signal for rescue teams if you're lost or in distress.
2. **Shelter:** Shelter provides protection from the elements and helps maintain your body's core temperature. Here are some key aspects of shelter in outdoor survival:
   - **Protection from Weather:** Shelter shields you from rain, snow, wind, and extreme temperatures. Exposure to harsh weather conditions can lead to hypothermia or heat-related illnesses.
   - **Safety:** A shelter can provide a sense of safety and security, reducing stress and anxiety in a survival situation.
   - **Rest:** Adequate rest is crucial for maintaining physical and mental well-being. A shelter allows you to rest more comfortably, conserving energy for other survival tasks.
   - **Privacy:** Shelter can offer privacy, which can be important for maintaining dignity and personal hygiene in a challenging environment.
   - **Materials:** Shelter can be constructed using various materials, including natural resources like branches and leaves, or with the help of a tarp, emergency blanket, or a tent if you have them available.
In addition to fire and shelter, water and food are two more crucial elements needed for outdoor survival. Here are these essentials along with a few other key considerations:
3. **Water:** Access to clean water is vital for staying hydrated and maintaining bodily functions. Without water, survival becomes significantly more challenging. Here's what you need to know about water:
   - **Purification:** Ensure you have a way to purify water from natural sources, such as rivers or streams. This can be done through boiling, using water purification tablets, or using a portable water filter.
   - **Containers:** Carry containers, such as water bottles or canteens, to collect and store water. Having a way to carry water helps ensure you have a supply while you search for more.
4. **Food:** While food is important for sustenance, humans can survive for a considerable amount of time without it, especially if there is access to water. However, having a source of food can boost your energy and morale. Here's what you should consider:
   - **Edible Plants:** Learn to identify edible plants in your environment. Some plants can provide nourishment in a survival situation.
   - **Foraging and Hunting:** If you have the skills and tools, foraging for edible plants and hunting or fishing for food can be options for sourcing sustenance.
   - **Emergency Rations:** It's wise to carry non-perishable, high-energy food items in your survival kit, such as energy bars, dried fruits, nuts, or jerky.

## Other Priorities Outdoors
1. **Navigation Tools:** To increase your chances of being rescued or finding your way to safety, consider carrying navigation tools such as a map, compass, or GPS device.
2. **First Aid Kit:** A basic first aid kit is essential for treating injuries and preventing infections. It should include bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and any personal medications you may need.
3. **Communication:** If possible, carry a communication device like a cell phone or a satellite communicator. These can be essential for calling for help or staying in touch with rescue teams.
4. **Clothing:** Dress in layers appropriate for the environment you're in. Good clothing can help regulate your body temperature and protect you from the elements.
5. **Knowledge and Skills:** Perhaps the most crucial element is knowledge and the skills to use the items in your survival kit effectively. Knowing how to start a fire, build a shelter, find food and water, and administer first aid are all critical skills.
Remember that the specific items and skills needed can vary depending on the environment and the duration of your outdoor adventure or emergency situation. Proper preparation, including acquiring knowledge and practicing survival skills, is key to increasing your chances of survival in the wilderness.

In many survival situations, the ability to create fire and establish shelter will be your top priorities. These skills, along with knowledge of basic survival techniques, can greatly increase your chances of staying safe and surviving until rescue or assistance arrives.
