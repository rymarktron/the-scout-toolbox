# Hiking
Hiking is an exhilarating outdoor activity that allows individuals to connect with nature while exploring diverse landscapes. While it can be immensely enjoyable, it's essential to understand some important concepts to ensure a safe and enjoyable hiking experience:

## Buddy System
This is an important procedure when people break off in a group:
Let someone know what you are doing
Have a whistle (blow it loud in the case of an emergency)
If possible, carry a walkie talkie

The goal is to prevent separation. In some scenarios, there would be a person in the front and back of a group. Also the troop sometimes encourages bright jackets to be worn on outings/ have reflective tape on their jackets. During hiking trips, we might put special tape on trees so we can find our direction back. 

If you are lost then blow your whistle 3 times, stay calm, and if applicable, use your survival kit and prepare for the worst.

Two other resources: building a survival kit and hug a tree.

## Compass
![Compass](https://www.hillwalktours.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/silva-type4-compass-edited.jpg)
There are 16 points on a compass. There are four directions: north, east, south, and west. With a park map, you’ll be able to see the location you are trying to head to. As well, look for location indicators (e.g. facilities, bodies of water).

Limitations: You only know the direction and will need map, cannot place near metal objects

- Natural Compass: The sun rises from the east and sets in the west. As well, wind usually blows from the west.
- [Physics Behind a Compass](#): The Earth has a magnetic field which also happens to protect us from the harmful solar waves. True North - North Pole. Magnetic North - This changes every year due to slight rotations. Need to adjust with map reading


To use a compass, do the following:
Make sure the compass is away any metal as it may give a direction pointing towards that metal instead
Have the compass on a flat and the compass arrow parallel to the ground

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.

## Emergencies
If you are lost, stay where you are and set up shelter, unless they know where you group is (e.g. on a one-way trail). For the younger sections, we tell them to “hug a tree” if they are lost. The result is the same effect where a tree acts as shelter. Besides, it will be easier for others to find you if you stay where you are.

Emergency Signals and Signalling Devices
SOS - Create SOS with some trees. The bigger the better. The idea is it attracts helicopters
Flare - To fire a flare, screw it tightly onto the launcher, then pull back the firing button to rest in the notch. Snapping the button out of the notch strikes the flare with a firing pin, launching it up to 300 feet as it burns for 6.5 seconds. Best to do in water to avoid causing a forest fire
Mirrors - Hold the mirror close to your eyes. Look through aperture. Extend the other arm and with the middle finger, make a V. Place the target at top of B. Tilt the mirror so it reflects sunlight to fingers. Each time you sweep bright reflection, you send a signal flash to target
Horn - Long whistle blast

## Common Injuries
Simple Sprain
RICE Treatment: Rest, Immobilize, Cold (Use ice), Elevation
 
Blisters: They are caused by the rubbing of skin on another object. To treat a blister, do the following:
Wash your hands and the blister with water or another disinfectant
Use a disinfectant (e.g. rubbing alcohol) to clean the blister
Sterilize a sharp needle and use it to puncture the blister. Let the fluid drain. 
Add an ointment (e.g. polysporin, vaseline) on the blister
Cover the blister with a bandaid

Make sure to stay on the path or avoid going through the forest to avoid damaging the environment.

## Hiking Equipment
### Backpacks
If you have a chance, try to go to a store with the Scout group. When choosing a backpack, consider the following:
Size
Waist strap and hip strap (necessity to distribute weight; goal is to have least amount of weight on shoulders)
Number of compartments
Some people like having a water/hydration bladder where you can drink from your water bottle using a long straw usually connected to your bag. Some bags offer it at purchase

Put the heaviest clothing at the bottom. Less accessible

### Hiking Boots
Gore Tex - waterproof hiking boots. They are very helpful when backpacking, especially when there are many puddles. They only last for around a year or two when used. Will need to reseal after.
Heel Support - Extra part on the back of the boot to protect the heel. 

As well, look after your footwear by cleaning it and waterproofing it regularly. It will last longer and be more comfortable over time. Wear the right socks (neither too tight or loose), avoid cotton, sock liner. 

### Sunscreen
There are different ratings (more effective)
If spray, spray close to skin and then pour around
Aerosols will dissipate in air and will likely not go to the intended place

### Water
Consider Nalgene 1L water bottle. For warm drinks, use metal bottle but be careful

### Hiking Stick
Find straight wood in woods that is approximately your height. Bring home and use the knife to peel wood and let it dry fully. You can put a laminent on it to keep its form. This can give more stability.

## Reading a Map
A waypoint is a specific location in coordinates on a GPS. On a GPS unit, you can save multiple waypoints to mark different points on a trail. When you reach those points, you will know that you are not lost.

As well, on many topography maps, there will be some coordinates on the edges of the map. By looking at the edges of the map, it will give you coordinates and their spacing. You can find your point and have two imaginary lines (one horizontal and vertical from your point of interest. Where it lies on the edges will tell you the coordinates. Afterwards, it is easy to put it on a GPS. The reverse can happen where you find a point, look for the topography point then input in GPS.

Trail Markers
The image on the left shows the trail marker signs that are common in popular trails. By following and looking for these markers regularly, you’ll always know that you are following the trail. Additionally, different trails may use different colours with some signage indicating which is which at the trailhead and sometimes junctions. 

Inukshuks are also a marker that you are following the right trail. Seeing people around you is also a good indicator that you are going in the right direction.
