## Properties of Different Plants

<Properties>
  <Property name="Hardwood vs Softwood" type="Trees">
    Hardwood burns for longer periods of time and are desirable for campfires and cooking fires. On the contrary, softwood is good and easy to cut. Be aware of the difference as it will be important for different situations.
    Deciduous - softwood. Coniferous - hardwood
  </Property>
  <Property name="Alive vs Dead" type="Trees">
  Use dead trees for fires, not trees that are alive. Dead trees are usually brown in colour, the interior is dark and dry, and they are not connected to roots. The biggest reason why you choose a dead tree is it is usually dry on the inside, and as a result, it burns better. For live trees, they have water to keep the tree alive which takes even more time and energy to burn; you also get smoke from the water.
  The same applies for branches. If you can see green, then donâ€™t burn as it will take longer to burn (live = has water).

### Fall Colours
In the Fall, the cold temperatures and less sunlight. Plants save energy by stopping the production of Chrlophyll II and as a results, the leaves change colours and eventually fall. Rain will result in leaves falling down at a faster rate.
It can be a beautiful sight to see and it gives insight

In Ontario, there are two key periods:
Maples (Mid-September)
Red/orange colour
Will turn brown and fall
