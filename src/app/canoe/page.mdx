# Canoe

These are the most fun adventures. There can be a number of risks: lightning, wildlife, current, getting lost; so, you take precautions.

Portage: Be sure to bring and use a pad for the yolk. It will better distribute the weight and give greater comfort. Carry as much from one side to another (usually one or two backpacks plus smaller items/bags).

## Float Plan / Backcountry Emergency
The purpose of a float plan is to let someone anticipate where you are going in case something goes wrong and you are in need of search and rescue. Usually, you can tell a different Scouter not going on the trip where you are going and the Park Ranger at the parkâ€™s office. Telling them information, such as tent colours, group size, planned campsites, and most importantly, planned route. Constantly keep in contact with parents at certain checkpoints: arrival, leaving.

Call 911 if there is a cellular signal. If you know there is a cellular signal somewhere, you may need to travel there to get help. You could also use SMS which will send a location. If none of those are options, use an emergency signal. Treat the person and try to help them.

Equipment: Keep equipment in water proof/resistant bags. As well, protect your map by putting it in a protected place or buy a waterproof map.
