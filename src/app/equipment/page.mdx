# Equipment Use and Safety
## The Importance of Safety
Safety first always. These tools can be weapons for the inexperienced, but useful for the skilled. It is important to have an understanding of the safety and practice before using it at camps. Experienced Scouters usually give a permit (paper/pin) acknowledging that the Scout knows how to use it and can be trusted. If the trust is violated, the permit can be taken back.

Bow Drill - pull and push fast fast
Little piece of tinder (cedar works great). Have something flammable nearby so it catches on fire then move to the campfire. More challenging to do but certainly possible

Extinguishing a Campfire
After having a campfire, you must safely put it out, otherwise there could be great issues if it spreads. Once all the wood in the fire burns out you need to clean up the area and leave no trace. To make sure the fire is out, put water on top. If you are not using a designated campfire spot, get the coal/ashes using wood and gloves and disperse them across the forest the next day.

## Camp Fuel Stove
![Stove](https://www.switchbacktravel.com/sites/default/files/image_fields/Informational%20Articles/How%20to%20Choose%20a%20Camping%20Stove/How%20to%20choose%20camp%20stove%20%28number%20of%20burners%29.jpg)

To set the stove with a bottle attached to the side of the stove, flip the bottle. There should be ⅔ of the bottle full
Pump about twenty times pressure to the gas
Connect to the stove
Gas will go to the pipe because of the pressure
Turn on then off to allow some gas to go
Light the stove and let gas light up



Types of Fuel
Isobutane Fuel: butane + propane (can be used in various climate conditions/temperatures)
White Gas
Camp Fuel: A much more efficient gas (x2.5 better than isobutane). Kept in a red container for safety.
Alcohol
*Fuel powers stove, lantern, and mosquito barrier.

### Portable Stove
To set the stove with gas connected below the stove, place it on the ground
Clear the area from any potential fire hazards
The heated pipe will gasify the hydrocarbon and then burn
Pump then light

Using the Portable Lightweight Stove
To start, turn on/off the stove. Turn on the stove to have some gas then light it up. Let it burn. Turn on slowly
To turn off: When cleaning up, release gas slowly to remove pressure. Flip the gas can to turn off. Let the remaining gas residue burn.


## Saw and Axe Skills
![How to Use a Saw Poster](https://images.twinkl.co.uk/tw1n/image/private/t_630_eco/image_repo/a9/6d/t-tp-1269-how-to-use-a-saw-a4-display-poster-english_ver_2.jpg)
Axes and saws have to be sharpened when it becomes more dull. For saws, you sharpen each individual tooth. For axes, you just sharpen the tip. Stoves have to be cleaned inside the machine and get a refill on gas.

Saw
Hand saw (make sure it is locked before using). Usually they are a pull back saw where you bring the hand saw up and then pull
Two person saw - keep momentum, consistent pull, pull full way to get maximum efficiency
Make sure saw is going in straight — the blade is not bending
Apply downward force so the saw continues to saw wood
Similar to a knife, there should be a perimeter where people cannot go. Always position saw away from you
Axe
Keep feet shoulder distance apart
Let gravity be the only force that is used when  and have first hit so you have a part
After you can use a piece of wood and hit the axe which is on a cut in the wood; repeat until part is broken
You can kneel if you want
Put the axe guard on whenever you are done; keep axe in a common area so it is not a hazard
The axe zone is around three meters each way (wood can swing)

Big piece of wood - used for chopping wood 

*If you are experienced, you can swing a little harder to break it
