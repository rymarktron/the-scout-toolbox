# Winter Camping

## Layering
Layering Principle
- Wear a thermal layer
- Wear polyester or wool shirt/pants
- Wear windproof jacket and wool socks
*if you are warm, then you take off one layer at a time

## Main First Aid Concerns
1. Hypothermia, Frostbite
- Wear gloves when you are outdoors and a hat (most heat will radiate from your head; extremities such as fingers and ears are important to cover in insulation, as they are the most prone to frostbite problems and lose the most energy)
- If you are too cold, go inside (Car or lodge depending on what’s available); as well, put your hands in your armpits so they can warm up slowly.
- Drink water frequently (you can put your water bottle in snow, full-covered, and it won’t freeze)
- As Scouters, ask the question, “Are you cold? How are you feeling?”, regularly with the youth to make sure they are okay

2. Wet Clothes 
- Take them off as soon as you can and replace them with new dry clothes. You can put them on a wood stove or another heat source to melt

3. Snow Blindness
- A painful, temporary e.g. 24-hours loss of vision from over exposure to sun's rays. This can be from the snow or water.
- Snow has a high percent of light that is reflected (due to the light colour)
- Simple Prevention: Wear sunglasses, stay indoors
- Treatment: Stay indoors and wear sunglasses. Furthermore, keep your eyes moist by using artificial tears. Lastly, do not rub your eyes.

## Quinzees, Winter Shelters
A quinzee is a type of dome-shaped structure made of compacted snow, and it can be a fun and unique experience for senior Troop members to build and sleep in. To create a quinzee, start by having the Scouts gather a large pile of snow and use shovels or their bodies to compress it, removing as many air pockets as possible. Place sticks at the end of the mound to mark the depth, and cover the hole with garbage bags to help it freeze overnight.
The next day, use a smaller shovel or your hands to dig out the interior of the quinzee, creating a semi-spherical shape. Make sure to include a ventilation hole at the top, slanted at around a 45-degree angle, to allow CO2 to escape and fresh air to enter. You may also want to bring a groundsheet and insulated sleeping bag to sleep in the quinzee, as the snow on the bottom and inside may melt from body heat. Depending on the size of the interior, one or two people can sleep in a quinzee. You can also bring a lantern to provide additional heat if desired.

A checklist to use:
Have the Scouts create a pile of snow. A suggestion is to have Scouts bring shovels to move the snow. Have people lie on it to compress the snow. The compact snow will have less air pockets and be able to freeze into something more durable.
Put sticks at the end of the night to be an indicator how far you dug. These sticks should be one feet long.
Bring garbage bags to cover hole for quinzee
Try to fill the mound as much as possible and then wait a night for it to freeze
Use a smaller shovel or hands to dig a hole. This should be a semi sphere interior.
Create a ventilation hole at the top, slightly slanted (around 45 degrees). This will be where CO2 escapes. Air will enter through the entrance (make the entrance smaller). CO2 is lighter than air, so it will go up.
To sleep in a quinzee, you will need a groundsheet and insulated sleeping bag. The snow on the bottom and in the quinzee will melt from the heat. As well, if you want, you can have a lantern as a heat source in the quinzee. Usually one or two people can sleep in a quinzee. It will depend on the
