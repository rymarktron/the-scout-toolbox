# Camping

Camping lies at the heart of the scouting experience, embodying adventure, camaraderie, and self-discovery. For scouts, it's more than just spending time outdoors; it's about embracing nature, learning practical skills, and fostering resilience. Central to the scouting ethos is the importance of being prepared, both in terms of equipment and skills. Scouts understand the significance of carrying the right gear, from tents and sleeping bags to first aid kits and navigation tools, ensuring safety and comfort in various outdoor conditions. Moreover, being prepared extends beyond physical equipment; it encompasses developing essential outdoor skills like fire-building, knot-tying, and map-reading, empowering scouts to navigate challenges and emergencies with confidence. Ultimately, camping for scouts is a holistic journey, instilling a deep appreciation for nature, a sense of responsibility, and the invaluable skill set needed for a lifetime of outdoor adventures.


## Packing List
Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Protocol offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

## Tents

1. Taking Down a Tent
2. Remove the tent pegs. You will work outwards
3. Take off the fly and shake off any water. Fold it lengthwise two times then width wise two times. Further folds may be required.
4. Take off the poles for the tent and fold them up. After, you can fold the tent similar to the fly. Keep the zippers a little open so the air can escape when you press on it later. When folding the tent, there may be a significant amount of air in the later folds. You can put the tent on the ground and lie on it so the air escapes. As well, you can tuck in any part of the tent that sticks out. After, put the folded up tent over the square-folded fly.
5. Fold the groundsheet similar to step 3
6. Roll up at the end. Put the tent and groundsheet slightly past the start of the fly when rolling.
If there is rain, put the wet fly in a garbage bag (consideration). Dry it later
