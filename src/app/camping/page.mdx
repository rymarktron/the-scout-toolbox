# Camping

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).
</Note>

## Packing List
Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Protocol offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

## Tents

1. Taking Down a Tent
2. Remove the tent pegs. You will work outwards
3. Take off the fly and shake off any water. Fold it lengthwise two times then width wise two times. Further folds may be required.
4. Take off the poles for the tent and fold them up. After, you can fold the tent similar to the fly. Keep the zippers a little open so the air can escape when you press on it later. When folding the tent, there may be a significant amount of air in the later folds. You can put the tent on the ground and lie on it so the air escapes. As well, you can tuck in any part of the tent that sticks out. After, put the folded up tent over the square-folded fly.
5. Fold the groundsheet similar to step 3
6. Roll up at the end. Put the tent and groundsheet slightly past the start of the fly when rolling.
If there is rain, put the wet fly in a garbage bag (consideration). Dry it later
