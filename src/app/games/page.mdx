# Games
Games play a pivotal role in fostering camaraderie and teamwork among youth. They offer an enjoyable way for young individuals to learn valuable life skills while creating lasting friendships.

## Different Types of Games

- Competitive vs non-competitive game
- For these games, be sure to set a time for how long the activity is and game rules before you play. A demonstration is also helpful.
